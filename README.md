Applying Classification Models To Predict The Type Of DryBeans.

Title of Project: Predicting the type of dry bean based on the dimensions and shape of the dry bean.

Project Plan:
1. Data Preprocessing: <br>
    -----Data Loading: Load the dataset from the provided CSV file. <br>
    -----Data Cleaning: Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.<br>
    -----Data Encoding: Encode variables using Label Encoding to convert in numerical format suitable for models. <br>
    -----Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.<br> 

2. Model Building:<br>
    ----- Using various classification models or algorithms to classify the income of an adult in our dataset based on various parameters or features and also evaluating each modelâ€™s performance using accuracy metrics classification reports and confusion matrix. <br>

    -----Models to be implemented: 

        -----Logistic Regression
            -----Suitable for binary classification tasks. 
            -----Provides probabilities for outcomes. 
            -----Interpretable coefficients allow understanding the impact of features on the target variable.
            
        -----Decision Trees
            -----Can handle both numerical and categorical data. 
            -----Intuitive and easy to interpret. 
            -----Automatically handles feature interactions and variable interactions. 
            
        -----Random Forests
            -----Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees for improved performance. 
            -----Reduces overfitting compared to individual decision trees. 
            -----Robust to outliers and noise in the data. 

        -----Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
            -----Effective in high-dimensional spaces. 
            -----Versatile due to the choice of different kernel functions. 
            ----- Memory efficient as it uses only a subset of training points in the decision function. 
        
        ----- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
            ----- Non-parametric method suitable for both classification and regression tasks.
            ----- Simple and intuitive approach based on similarity of data points. 
            ----- Can capture complex patterns in the data.. 

3. Next Steps:<br>
----- Implement the data preprocessing steps including loading, cleaning, and encoding the dataset.<br>
----- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.<br>
----- Build and train each classification model using the training data.<br>
----- Evaluate the performance of each model using accuracy metrics and classification reports.<br>
----- Plotting confusion metrics of each model as a heatmap.<br>
----- Select the best-performing model based on results or consider ensemble methods for improved accuracy.<br>
